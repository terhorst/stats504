This archive contains skeleton code for a prediction algorithm. 

- `predict` is a Python script that outputs a prediction of each of the 10 counties.
- `predict.R` is an equivalent R script. If you prefer to work in R, delete `predict` and rename `predict.R` to `predict`.
- You may include other files (for example, trained model weights) into this archive for use in prediction. At running time,
  we will unzip this archive and run `predict` in the unzipped directory, so you can use relative paths to refer to other files.

See the assignment page for further information.
